# Poke Stats

This directory includes the statistical analysis tools necessary for analysing
the outcomes of the fights.

So far this includes:

- Benchmarking the method via clustering the results of 1v1 fights against base
  stats, looking to recreate the tier list.
  - This can be achieved by running 1v1_fights.py, the base stats are found in
    poke_base_stats.pkl
